Hi there! I'm Ziad, and I have a great passion for RF electronics and signal processing. My current research is focused on millimeter-wave measurements (mm-wave metrology), and I'm eager to share my knowledge with you. The goal of this website is to make the complex world of RF technology more accessible and understandable. My goal is simply to spread knowledge and help others gain a better understanding of this field, so enjoy reading!
