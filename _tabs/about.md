Hi there! My name is Ziad and I'm passionate about RF electronics and signal processing. I do research on millimeter-wave measurements (mm-wave metrology) and I'm excited to share my knowledge with you. Through this website, I hope to make the often complex world of RF technology more approachable and understandable. My goal is simply to spread knowledge and help others grow in their understanding of this field. So, have fun reading!
